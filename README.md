# BIG-INTEGER-LIBRARY
This library contains various methods for performing all the arthematic operations such as addition, subtraction, divison ,multiplication , modulo operation, postfix, prefix and many more on intergers larger than 64 bits. It consists of a big integer class which has two data member, one is number which is string and it stores the absolute value of the integer and other is sign which is char and it tells whether the integer is negative or positive. And it has various methods for performing the operations. It uses the concept of operator overloading to redefine the working of a operator so that it can also be used for integer larger than 64 bits.
